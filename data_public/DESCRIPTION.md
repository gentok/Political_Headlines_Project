### 1.2 Variables

Each Dataset comes with following variables:

   * <code>**id_all**</code>: Global headline id (each headline has a unique ID)
   * <code>id_inpaper</code>: With-in paper headline id (each headline in the same newspaper has a unique ID)
   * <code>id_original</code>: Headline ID from original dataset (can be ignored)
   * <code>year</code>: Year of headline
   * <code>month</code>: Month of headline
   * <code>date</code>: Day of headline
   * <code>**ymonth**</code>: Year-month of headline
   * <code>**Headline**</code>: The raw texts of headline
   * <code>**paper**</code>: Character string for the newspaper. "A" indicates Asahi, "Y" indicates Yomiuri.
   * <code>**wcount**</code>: Word count for each article attached with headline
   * <code>**codePN**</code>: Manually coded positive-negative sentiment (in terms of Prime Minister) of headlines. *The code is still not final. Some values are missing.*
   * <code>Asahi</code>: Dummy for Asahi newspaper. 1 for headlines from Asahi.
   * <code>Yomiuri</code>: Dummy for Yomiuri newspaper. 1 for headlines from Yomiuri.
   * <code>jijistartdate</code>: The date when *jiji monthly poll* start to collect the data in each month.
   * <code>**jijiymonth**</code>: Year-month according to *jiji monthly poll*. The month is considered to start when *jiji monthly poll* starts to collect its data (jijistartdate) in current month, and ends at the day before *jiji monthly poll* starts to collect data for next month.
   * <code>cabinet</code>: The dummy variable for cabinet / prime minister related headline.
   * <code>ldp</code>: The dummy variable for Liberal Democratic Party related headline.
   * <code>politics</code>: The dummy variable for general politics related headline.

## 2. Word Appearance Matrix Data

 The following datasets are used to machine-learn the contents of newspaper headlines. **Rows represent headlines and columns represent words.**

 NOTE: Text matrix datasets are VERY large files, so they are **not uploaded to GitHub**. Ask authors if you are interested in looking inside of data.

 ### 2.1 Datasets

 Each word appearnce matrix data has **identical row number as <code>id_all</code> variable** in corresponding headline data.

  * <code>cabinetWrdMat.csv</code> is a word appearance matrix data that corresponds to <code>cabinetdata.csv</code>. It includes 17176 rows (headlines) and 10069 columns (words). <br>

  * <code>ldpWrdMat.csv</code> is a word appearance matrix data that corresponds to <code>ldpdata.csv</code>. It includes 4766 rows (headlines) and 4844 columns (words).<br>

  * <code>politicsWrdMat.csv</code> is a word appearance matrix data that corresponds to <code>politicsdata.csv</code>. It includes 16156 rows (headlines) and 10354 columns (words).

 ### 2.2 Variables

 **Each column represents word** (i.e., noun, adjective, verb, ...). The value indicates **the frequency of word appearance**. The value often takes 1 or 0, but not necessarily. ***If the same word appears twice (or more) in one headline, then the value takes 2 or more.*** You need to recode the variable if you want to use these variables as dummy word appearnce in headline.

 The dataset includes ALL words (except for signs (e.g., parentheses, dots, ...) and other meaningless terms) that **appeared at least once** in whole data. It may be inefficient to include all those variables in the analysis. We can set some threshold of minimum frequency of word appearance to shrink dataset.
