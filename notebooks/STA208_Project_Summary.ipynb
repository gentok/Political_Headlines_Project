    "Using unique dataset of Japanese Newspaper Headlines, this project asks two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Can unsupervised-learning methods identify the major categories of news appeared on headlines?\n",
    " * How good supervised-learning methods are to predict positive/negative (PN) sentiments expressed in news headlines?\n",

    "## III. Analytical Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two major objectives in the analysis, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Explore major categories of news through unsupervised and machine learning.\n",
    " 2. Predict negative sentiments appeared on headlines through supervised machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are interested in identifying major categories of news contents ([Section IV](STA208_Unsupervised_Learning.ipynb)). We don't have pre-defined set of categories, therefore, we impletement **unsupervised learning methods (K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering)** to explore the major categories appeared in this dataset. We then briefly look into generated categories to assess if each of the method is successful in extracting meaningful categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we are also interested in coding positive-negative sentiments appeared in each headline ([Section V](STA208_Supervised_Learning.ipynb)). In this section, One of the author sample 1000 headlines from the full dataset, and manually code the dichotomous appearance of negative sentiment. Then, we use **supervised learning methods (K Nearest Neighbors, Logit, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Verctor Machine with RBF Kernel, Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and Adaboost)** to learn those negative-sentiment coding. We compare the result at the the last to evaluate how different methods perform differently on the learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Negative sentiments prediction from random forest (<code>rf_pred</code>) and logit (<code>logit_pred</code>) show similar patterns across topics, while logit predictions come with more extreme values (close to 0 or 1) than random forest predictions.\n",
    "2. *Crime-Economy*, *Social-Crime*, *Featured* and *Polling* topics are more likely to be negative than *Diplomacy*, *Politics* or *Election* topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "First pattern confirms the assessment in [Section V](STA208_Supervised_Learning.ipynb). Logit and random forest do seem to capture same characteristics in headlines. For the second pattern, it follows the expectation that *Crime* topic comes with high negative sentiment probability. On the other hand, it is interesting to see that *Polling* topic is highly likely to be negative, but *Politics* and *Diplomacy* are not. In general, negative sentiments and topics are related, but do seem to capture independent aspects of headline contents."

    "### 3. Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are interested in various methods to extract mearnigful characteristics from headline data. Despite short text nature of headlines, unsupervised learning did generate seemingly meaningful categories, and supervised learning did predict negative sentiments fairly well. As we are studying political science, our final goal is to apply those generated characteristics to answer substantive questions in political science. With this goal in mind, there are at least three directions to further develop this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can consider methods to generate more balanced categories of headlines and words. The current categories (from both *K-Means* and *Hierarchical Categories*) are highly unbalanced, and it is difficult to extract the specific meaning from the largest cluster (e.g., *General* category from K-means). More balanced categories will make full interpretation of categories possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we can incorporate the aspect of time into machine learning. Each headline in the dataset come with the posted date of the headline, while we are ignoring them for now. Major characteristics of data may transform across time. If we can learn and capture the dynamic change in the characteristic of data across time, it would benefit our understanding of media contents over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, in addition to the above data, we have access to monthly public opinion poll data of corresponding time (including such questions as cabinet approval, party approval, and subjective economic performance). Therefore, we can aggeregate the machine learned characteristics of headlines by month, and assess the relationship between media contents and public opinion."
