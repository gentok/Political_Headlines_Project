    "Using unique dataset of Japanese Newspaper Headlines, this project asks two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Can unsupervised-learning methods identify the major categories of news appeared on headlines?\n",
    " * How good supervised-learning methods are to predict positive/negative (PN) sentiments expressed in news headlines?\n",

    "## III. Analytical Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two major objectives in the analysis, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Explore major categories of news through unsupervised and machine learning.\n",
    " 2. Predict negative sentiments appeared on headlines through supervised machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are interested in identifying major categories of news contents [Section IV]. We don't have pre-defined set of categories, therefore, we impletement **unsupervised learning methods (K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering)** to explore the major categories appeared in this dataset. We then briefly look into generated categories to assess if each of the method is successful in extracting meaningful categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we are also interested in coding positive-negative sentiments appeared in each headline [Section V]. In this section, One of the author sample 1000 headlines from the full dataset, and manually code the dichotomous appearance of negative sentiment. Then, we use **supervised learning methods (K Nearest Neightbors, Logit, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Verctor Machine with RBF Kernel, Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and Adaboost)** to learn those negative-sentiment coding. We compare the result at the the last to evaluate how different methods perform differently on the learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last discussion section, we discuss potential future development of the project by cross-sectioning two codings we generated so far. \n",
